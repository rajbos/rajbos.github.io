I was working on a new .NET Core Unit/Integration Test project in a solution using Visual Studio and need to load some setting from the configuration. Naturally I wanted to use the same setup for retrieving those settings as in the real project, so I added a new file `appsettings.json`. Next up I wanted to add `appsettings.Development.json` just like we use in normal projects. Somehow I expected it to be nested beneath `appsettings.json`, like in the normal project. Of course, it didn't ðŸ˜„. While searching for a solution I noticed a lot of screenshots with the same issue: the files where not nested. Here is how to fix it.

## The solution
The solution is updating your csproj file with a (new) item group that indicates the behavior you want:
``` xml
 <ItemGroup>
    <None Update="appsettings.Development.json">
      <DependentUpon>appsettings.json</DependentUpon>
    </None>
  </ItemGroup>
```

With this you tell Visual Studio how you want this file to be displayed!

# Visual Studio Code
Note: unfortunately the solution above will __not__ work for Visual Studio code! 
For adding the same setup in Visual Studio Code you need to add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:
``` json
"explorer.fileNesting.enabled": true,
    "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
        "appsettings.json": "appSettings.*.json"
    },	
```
