I was building a new [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-actions) today with a Dockerfile and got a strange error... `unable to prepare context: path "/action" not found.

I was using a Dockerfile in a sub directory, but the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-docker-actions) indicates this is supported. So, what gives? Is it a mix-up of the file path? I'm testing it on Windows and can build the Dockerfile itself just fine ðŸ¤”. Tested with a backslash instead of a slash, but still an error:  
`unable to prepare context: unable to evaluate symlinks in Dockerfile path: lstat /path/to/Dockerfile`

# The fix

On a hunch (this has happened before!), I changed the file ending of the Dockerfile from CRLF into LF (created the file on Windows of-course!) and... ðŸŽ‰.

# For future reference

1. Check the line endings on your Dockerfile!
2. You can run an image in your GitHub Action in a subdirectory by using the correct path to it. It needs to be relative to the action.yml file!


``` yaml
# action.yml
name: 'Octogotchi'
description: 'Octogotchi'
branding:
  icon : alert-circle
  color: blue
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'action/Dockerfile'
```
