## Protect your Code with GitHub Security Features
Creating modern software has a lot of moving parts. We all build on top of the shoulders of giants by leveraging closed/open source packages or containers that other people have shared. That makes securing our software a lot more complex as well!

In this session, you'll learn what possible attack vectors you need to look for, how to protect yourself against them and how to leverage GitHub's features to make your life easier!

You will learn:
- Commit signing
- Dependabot
- Secret scanning
- Code scanning using CodeQL
