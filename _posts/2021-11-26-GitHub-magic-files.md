I keep coming across files in GitHub that have some mystic magic feeling to them. There's always a small incantation to come with them: the have to have the right name, the right extension *and* have to be stored in the right directory. I wanted to have an overview of all these spells for myself, so here we are ðŸ˜‰.

# Overview
A list of all the magic files / links that I came across in GitHub. I also created a LinkedIn Learning Course for ~25 of these files, with more detail how to use them. You can find that course on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/25-github-configuration-files-you-should-be-using).

Then there is a whole list of templates you can configure for issues / pull requests / discussion:

|Filename|Location|.github repo support|Description|Docs|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|FORM-NAME.yml|.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/||Issue templates with forms (in Beta for github.com, not available for GHES)|[Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)|

|Url query|In the url link||Create an issue with certain fields filled in with values|[Create issue with url query](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-url-query)|

|Discussion category templates|/.github/DISCUSSION_CATEGORY_TEMPLATES|?|Create discussion category templates|[Create discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms)|

Some of these are extra tricky, like for example the organization profile lives in a different directory and repo then the user profile readme: `.github` or in `.github-private` repo in the org and then in a folder named `profile`: README.md.

## Magic links
There are also some magic links that can be super useful.

|Link setup|Description|Documentation|
| --- | --- | --- |
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest|Permalink to the latest release|[Permalink to latest release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/linking-to-releases)|
|github.com/userhandle.keys|Get the public part of a users SSH key||
|github.com/userhandle.gpg|Get the public part of a users GPG key||
|github.com/userhandle.png|Get the profile picture of a user||
|avatars.githubusercontent.com/userhandle?s=32|Easy method to show user profile pictures anywhere. The `s` parameter is the size. Example output: ![Rob's avatar, which is a face only photo of his dog: Flynn](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/rajbos?s=32)||
|github.com/owner/repo#readme|Scroll the repo link to open up with the README text on the page. Since GitHub shows the file content of the repo first, this can be helpful to push you users down the page into the README section. This works because the README is based on a header in the page, so this is just normal HTML behaviour. |

## Atom feeds
A lot of things have atom feeds enabled. The things in all caps need to be configured:

|Link setup|Description|
|---|---|
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/commits.atom|Get an RSS feed for the commits in that repo|
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/commits/BRANCH.atom|Get an RSS feed for all the commits in that branch|
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/wiki.atom| Feed for the wiki in that repo|
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/discussions.atom|Get an RSS feed for the discussions in that repo|
|github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases.atom|Get an RSS feed for the releases in that repo|
|github.com/USER.atom|Get an RSS feed for the user's public activity|
|github.com/security-advisories|Get an RSS feed for ALL the security advisories|

There should also be a feed for issues, but I continuously get HTTP:406 errors on github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues.atom.
Other the user specific feeds can be loaded by making an authenticated call to `https://api.github.com/feeds`.

You can get an entire firehose of ALL issues on the GitHub platform if you want to: `- https://github.com/issues?q=`.

# Personal views
- github.com/issues - get a list of issues that are either created by you, or assigned to you
- github.com/pulls - get a list of pull requests that are either created by you, or assigned to you
- github.com/discussions - get a list of discussions that are either created by you, or assigned to you

## Using separate git configurations with SSH for the same user
You can add a `-` to the ssh url, to have different ssh configs on you machine and use the right one for the right repo.
Exampe: `git@github.com-myworkaccount:devops-actions/load-used-actions`.
This boils down to using a separate hostname (github.com-myworkaccount) to use for the configured repo (devops-actions/load-used-actions).
