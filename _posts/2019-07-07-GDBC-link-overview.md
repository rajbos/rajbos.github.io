Last month we got the opportunity to organize the Global DevOps Bootcamp ([link](https://www.globaldevopsbootcamp.com)) and it was a blast!

## Challenges
The GDBC team has opened up the challenges website we used during the event itself so everyone can go through the challenges (and behind the scenes videos) to keep on learning! Available under the creative commons (non-commercial) license on [gdbc-challenges.com](https://www.gdbc-challenges.com/)
