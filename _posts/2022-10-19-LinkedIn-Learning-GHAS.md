My LinkedIn Learning course on GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) has been released!
In this course I teach you all about the features of Advanced Security:
- Dependabot
- Code scanning
- Secret scanning

You can watch it with a LinkedIn Learning account (30 day trial is available) with this link: [GHAS on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/github-advanced-security/github-advanced-security?autoplay=true).
