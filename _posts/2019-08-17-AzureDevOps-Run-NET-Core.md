title: "Run .NET Core programs in Azure DevOps"

Recently I wanted to build and run a .NET core console application in Azure DevOps and found out you cannot do that with the default .NET core tasks.

The default tasks in Azure DevOps and [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003719) are more geared towards web-development and publishing a zip file that can be used with a WebDeploy command.

For an application,I would have thought that you could run the compiled assembly by calling `dotnet run path-to-assembly` on it. Turns out that the run command is used to run the code from a project, not from a compiled assembly (see the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run?tabs=netcore21&WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003719)).

You can just call `dotnet path-to-assembly`, but the .NET core tasks in Azure DevOps will not let you do that: you can select a custom command, but you cannot leave that command empty for example.

## Option 1: Publish the application to self-contained
Here's how to go around that limitation: publish the application for the platform(s) you want to run: that way you'll have an executable that can be executed with a PowerShell task. I choose the Windows platform as a target and published the files to a separate `publish` folder.

You can then run it in a release.
The release just consists of extracting the build artefact, overwriting the application settings with an [Azure DevOps Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sergeyzwezdin.magic-chunks) and running the executable.

## Option 2: Run the assembly
An even easier way to run the assembly is to call the dotnet command on the assembly itself, just do it in a PowerShell task:
