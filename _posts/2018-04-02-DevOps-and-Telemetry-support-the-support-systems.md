title: "DevOps and Telemetry: Support on the supporting systems"
date: 2018-04-02
---

**Note** This is part 3 in a series of posts about DevOps and the role of telemetry in it. In part one I described the reasoning behind the series and explained how I started with logging (usage) telemetry for a SaaS application. You can read part 1 in the series [here](/blog/2018/03/14/DevOps-and-Telemetry-Insights-into-your-application).
In this post I want to explain about the next step: logging information about the systems that support the application: servers, database, storage and anything that comes with that.
