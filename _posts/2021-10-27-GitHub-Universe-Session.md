# Follow up questions
Let me know if there are any follow up questions. You can tag me on the [discussions](https://github.com/githubevents/Universe2021/discussions) created for the event by using my GitHub handle: `rajbos` or comment on the YouTube video. I'll add them below for future reference!

## Setting up an internal marketplace
A blogpost on the topic to setup an internal marketplace can be found [here](https://devopsjournal.io/blog/2021/10/14/GitHub-Actions-Internal-Marketplace). It contains the full setup from having a process for your users to running security checks on the actions **before** you fork them over to be used (last past is still a work in progress).
