Today I shared my story on why and how we can protect ourselves against supply chain attacks. This talk was part of the DevCon Romania 2024 conference on the DevOps track.

I find it important to share with folks how to think about our supply chains in the software we deliver, from dependencies we deploy to production, to everything that touches the code __before__ it gets into the production environment. There are so many attack vectors in our pipelines that we need to be aware of and protect against.

We had a nice full room with lots of interested engineers and developers. I tried to inspire them to take a closer look at their pipelines and see where they can improve their security posture.
