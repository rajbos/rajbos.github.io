This one took me way to many trials and searches to figure out, so I wanted to store it here in case I need it later on.
Maybe someone else will find this useful as well ðŸ˜„.

# The premise
We have a pipeline for [GDBC](https://www.globaldevopsbootcamp.com) from June 2019 that uses [Pester](https://pester.dev) tests written in PowerShell to verify the outcome of our pipeline: we create (a lot of) resources in Azure and Azure DevOps and want to check if they actually exists.

We run the tests inside a PowerShell task in Azure DevOps and install the Pester module with this:
``` powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
Import-Module Pester
```
This of course installs the latest version. After moving things to a different environment, I skipped the tests for a while (booh!) and yesterday decided to add them back. And lo and behold: things where not working anymore.

The tricky part was getting things to work with a Pester file that holds parameters that we need to pass into it.

## Pester file has parameters
``` powershell
param (
    [string] $region,
    [string] $pathToJson,
    [string] $runDirectory
)
```
# Parameters we need:
To set things up, we need to set the parameters with some values to use:
``` powershell
$region="LocalDevOpsBootcamp"
$dataFilePath="c:\temp"
$datafilename="data-999.json"
```

# Pester 4.0
With the previous version of Pester we called Pester and added a `Data` object to pass in the variable values.

``` powershell
Invoke-Pester
 -Script 'GDBC-AzureDevopsProvisioning.Tests.ps1'
 -Data = @{
     region = '$region';
     pathToJson = '$dataFilePath/$datafilename';
     runDirectory = 'AzureDevOps-provisioning' }
 -OutputFile Test-Pester.XML
 -OutputFormat NUnitXML
```

## Error running the v4 setup against v5
This gave the following warning / error with version 5:
```
WARNING: You are using Legacy parameter set that adapts Pester 5 syntax to Pester 4 syntax. This parameter set is deprecated, and does not work 100%. The -Strict and -PesterOption parameters are ignored, and providing advanced configuration to -Path (-Script), and -CodeCoverage via a hash table does not work.

# Pester 5.*
This is the part that took me way to long to figure out. You can run Pester with a container by calling `Invoke-Pester -Container $container` and add the parameters to pass along to the test.
That is step 1.

If you also want to add settings, you need to **wrap the container in a configuration**!

So the steps are:
1. Create a container
1. Add the parameters **and** the testfile(s) to the container
1. Create a configuration
1. Add your settings on the configuration
1. Set the container as the `run` in the configuration
1. Run Pester with the configuration

## Example

``` powershell
# create a new container that will be executed
$container = New-PesterContainer
 -Path './gdbc2019-provisioning/AzureDevOps-provisioning/GDBC-AzureDevopsProvisioning.Tests.ps1'
 # include the parameters to pass into the Pester file
 -Data @{
     region = '$region';
     pathToJson =
     "$dataFilePath/$datafilename";
     runDirectory = './gdbc2019-provisioning/AzureDevOps-provisioning'
     }

# create a new configuration with our settings
$config = New-PesterConfiguration
$config.TestResult.OutputFormat = "NUnitXML"
$config.TestResult.OutputPath = "Test-Pester.XML"
$config.TestResult.Enabled = $True

# configure the run with the new container from step 1
$config.Run.Container = $container

# actually call Pester
Invoke-Pester -Configuration $config
```
