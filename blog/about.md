## Hi, I am Rob üëã
I do DevOps-y stuff, mostly with C# and GitHub/Azure/Azure DevOps.

## Work | Xebia üî®
In my day job I work for [Xebia Microsoft Services](https://website.xebia.com/digital-transformation/microsoft-services/github) as a DevOps consultant & GitHub Trainer, helping our customers with whatever they need regarding DevOps. Whether it's training, finding out some obscure issues, setting up their CI/CD pipelines, or helping them on their way to implement more DevOps patterns and practices, I help them with it. A lot of focus these days goes into improving their security setup, and looking at supply chain issues. Often I find myself helping teams with modern agile and DevOps practices in more of a coaching role. Focused on GitHub!

## Trainer: GitHub Accredited and Microsoft Certified üê†
I am a GitHub trainer for the GitHub (non-)developer, Copilot, Advanced Security, and GitHub Actions trainings. I also give several Bootcamps including a GitHub Advanced Security Bootcamp and the GitHub Partner Bootcamps that are needed to become a GitHub Accredited Trainer. Next to that I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer for AZ-900, AZ-204, and AZ-400 (DevOps on Azure track) as well as the AI-900 and AI-102 paths.  

I'm also a LinkedIn Learning Instructor. My courses are:
 - [GitHub Advanced Security](/blog/2022/10/19/LinkedIn-Learning-GHAS)
 - [25 GitHub configuration files you should be using](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/25-github-configuration-files-you-should-be-using)
 - [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github-advanced-security-for-azure-devops/)
 - [GitHub Models - Enterprise AI Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/enterprise-ai-development-with-github-models-and-azure/ai-with-github-models)

## Bots ü§ñ
* GitHub Action updates: I created a bot to keep you up to date on new and improved actions on the GitHub marketplace. Follow the link here [GitHub Actions Marketplace News](https://devops-actions.github.io/github-actions-marketplace-news/) and subscribe to the RSS feed for updates!
* Discontinued! AzDo Marketplace updates: I created a Twitter bot named [AzDoMarketNews](https://twitter.com/azdomarketnews) to keep up to date on new and improved extensions on the Azure DevOps marketplace.

## Community | GDEX ü¶¶
I help out with the Global DevOps Experience ([link]([https://www.globaldevopsex.com](https://www.globaldevopsx.com/)), mostly with automating stuff and setting up the infrastructure we need each year. In the 2019 edition of Global DevOps Bootcamp we had over 10.000 attendees spread out all over the world, spending their free Saturday with our platform getting hands-on experience on DevOps topics. For the 2020 edition I've started vlogging about the relevant information/announcements/background stuff [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnpc4jNC9lBWh-oq3aaPfFP5_tUMy7ZJ) and I have spoken about the event and platform for it several times. The session on DevOps Fest 2020 was recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJOnXj3pbKU&list=PLuOBDBq7MW73LKG7492aCRpSkLqqlJp32&index=25).
