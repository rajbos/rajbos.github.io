## Hi, I am Rob üëã
I do DevOps-y stuff, mostly with C# and GitHub/Azure/Azure DevOps.

## Work | Xpirit üî®
In my day job I work for Xpirit [link](https://www.xpirit.com/rob) as a DevOps consultant, helping our customers with whatever they need regarding DevOps. Whether it's training, finding out some obscure issues, setting up their CI/CD pipelines, or helping them on their way to implement more DevOps patterns and practices, I help them with it. Often I find myself helping teams with modern agile and DevOps practices in more of a coaching role. Focused on GitHub!

## Trainer: GitHub Accredited and Microsoft Certified
I am a GitHub trainer for the GitHub (non-)developer and GitHub Actions trainings. I also give several Bootcamps including a GitHub Advanced Security Bootcamp. Next to that I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer for AZ-900, AZ-204, and AZ-400 ( DevOps on Azure track).  
I'm also a LinkedIn Learning Instructor. My first course is on [GitHub Advanced Security](/blog/2022/10/19/LinkedIn-Learning-GHAS).

## Twitter Bots ü§ñ
* AzDo Marketplace updates: I created a Twitter bot named [AzDoMarketNews](https://twitter.com/azdomarketnews) to keep up to date on new and improved extensions on the Azure DevOps marketplace.
* GitHub Action updates: I created a Twitter bot named [GitHubActions](https://twitter.com/GitHubActions) to keep up to date on new and improved actions on the GitHub marketplace.

## Community | GDBC ü¶¶
I help out with the Global DevOps Bootcamp ([link](https://www.globaldevopsbootcamp.com)), mostly with automating stuff and setting up the infrastructure we need each year. In the 2019 edition we had over 10.000 attendees spread out all over the world, spending their free Saturday with our platform getting hands-on experience on DevOps topics. For the 2020 edition I've started vlogging about the relevant information/announcements/background stuff [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnpc4jNC9lBWh-oq3aaPfFP5_tUMy7ZJ) and I have spoken about the event and platform for it several times. The session on DevOps Fest 2020 was recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJOnXj3pbKU&list=PLuOBDBq7MW73LKG7492aCRpSkLqqlJp32&index=25).
