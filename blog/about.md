Hi there, I am a ALM/DevOps consultant at [Xpirit](https://xpirit.com/rob) with a focus on the feedback loop from operations back to the organisation and automating the snot out of things. I have a background in ASP.NET MVC development, incl. .NET Core and hosting it all on the Microsoft Azure platform.

Together with my wife we raise our two sons, love summer vacationing in France and winters in Austria or Switzerland. In our spare time we go on walks with the dog, play soccer, go biking or skating with the kids. 

I like going to the movies, read a lot of fantasy and sometimes find the time to play Tak (a [board game](https://cheapass.com/tak/) from a [book](https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp)).
