## Hi, I am Rob 👋
I do DevOps-y stuff, mostly with C# and GitHub/Azure/Azure DevOps.

## Work | Xebia 🔨
In my day job I work for [Xebia Microsoft Services](https://website.xebia.com/digital-transformation/microsoft-services/github) as a DevOps consultant & GitHub Trainer, helping our customers with whatever they need regarding DevOps. Whether it's training, finding out some obscure issues, setting up their CI/CD pipelines, or helping them on their way to implement more DevOps patterns and practices, I help them with it. A lot of focus these days goes into improving their security setup, and looking at supply chain issues. Often I find myself helping teams with modern agile and DevOps practices in more of a coaching role. Focused on GitHub!

## Trainer: GitHub Accredited and Microsoft Certified 🐠
I am a GitHub trainer for the GitHub (non-)developer, Copilot, Advanced Security, and GitHub Actions trainings. I also give several Bootcamps including a GitHub Advanced Security Bootcamp and the GitHub Partner Bootcamps that are needed to become a GitHub Accredited Trainer.  
Next to that I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer for AZ-900, AZ-204, and AZ-400 (DevOps on Azure track) as well as the AI-900 and AI-102 paths.  

I'm also a LinkedIn Learning Instructor. My courses are:
 - [GitHub Advanced Security](/blog/2022/10/19/LinkedIn-Learning-GHAS)
 - [25 GitHub configuration files you should be using](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/25-github-configuration-files-you-should-be-using)
 - [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github-advanced-security-for-azure-devops/)
 - [GitHub Models - Enterprise AI Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/enterprise-ai-development-with-github-models-and-azure/ai-with-github-models)
 - [Responsible GitHub Copilot: Creating Reliable Code Ethically](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/responsible-github-copilot-creating-reliable-code-ethically-24981582/genai-and-creating-code-responsibly)

## Books 📚
I have co-authored the following books:  
- GitHub Actions in Action - Continuous integration and delivery for DevOps
- The GitHub Copilot Handbook - A practical guide for teams and enterprises

### The GitHub Copilot Handbook: A practical guide to transforming the software development life cycle with GitHub Copilot

|Cover|Description|
|---|---|
|![Cover of the book](/images\Books\2025-TheGitHubCopilotHandBook.png) |Cross-functional product teams are under constant pressure to build and ship faster, but too much time is lost to manual coding, slow reviews, and fragmented workflows. GitHub Copilot streamlines day-to-day coding so your team can focus on delivering value to users while maintaining high quality on real projects. Written by industry experts Rob Bos and Randy Pagels, this book shows how GitHub Copilot supports your work from start to finish. You’ll learn how to turn ideas into tasks, write code with fewer hiccups, spot problems earlier, and understand errors when things go wrong. You’ll also see how Copilot suggests improvements in pull requests and helps fix common build issues, enabling teams to keep moving and ship with confidence. You’ll integrate GitHub Copilot into daily routines, share it across roles, and make it stick with simple checklists and clear examples. You’ll also track what works, set guardrails, and build an internal community. By the end, you’ll know when GitHub Copilot helps – and when it doesn’t – and you’ll be ready to write, review, and ship code with confidence on real projects.

## Community | GDEX 🦦
I help out with the Global DevOps Experience ([link]([https://www.globaldevopsex.com](https://www.globaldevopsx.com/)), mostly with automating stuff and setting up the infrastructure we need each year. In the 2019 edition of Global DevOps Bootcamp we had over 10.000 attendees spread out all over the world, spending their free Saturday with our platform getting hands-on experience on DevOps topics. For the 2020 edition I've started vlogging about the relevant information/announcements/background stuff [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCnpc4jNC9lBWh-oq3aaPfFP5_tUMy7ZJ) and I have spoken about the event and platform for it several times. The session on DevOps Fest 2020 was recorded [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJOnXj3pbKU&list=PLuOBDBq7MW73LKG7492aCRpSkLqqlJp32&index=25).
